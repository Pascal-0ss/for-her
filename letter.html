    <h3>For someone I really admire.</h3>

    <p>
        I've been holding something big inside me for a while—the feelings I thought I could change.
        Over the past few years, it’s still been you.
      </p>

      <p>
        At some point in our lives, we were happy… together.
        We shared experiences, and we knew how to make each other happy.
        But there came a time when everything changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We lost contact for so many years—three years.
        I thought I could get over you.
        I tried to love someone else, but all I could think about was you.
        I tried to stop my feelings, but in the end, I still lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when I finally realized that no matter what happened, it would still be you.
        It was always you.
      </p>

      <p>
        In those three years, I tried to figure myself out.
        I learned, I grew, and I changed in ways I never expected.
        I was so unsure about my feelings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet through all of that, the thought of you never really left.
        I don’t know what the future holds, and I’m not asking for anything more than honesty.
        I just wanted you to know the truth I’ve been carrying—because some feelings don’t fade with time;
        they just wait to be understood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even after all this time, a part of me believes that some connections are rare and meaningful.
        Maybe we crossed paths again for a reason, or maybe this is just the closure I needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Either way, I’m grateful for what we once had and for what it taught me.
        I’m not here to reopen old wounds or change the past.
        I wanted to be better for the future.
        You mattered to me—and in many ways, you still do.
      </p>

      <p>You are something special to me. You make my days brighter than ever. You'll always have a space within me.</p>
      <p>Taking things slow is what I want. Even miles apart, I feel every smile, every word, every little things you do. I want to savor this, to let it grow naturally, without rushing, without pressure. Because you make ordinary days brighter, and I don't want to miss a single moment of this quiet connection we share, even from across the world.</p>
